# Padeir0's Intermediate Representation

Intermediate representation meant to be used in my compilers.

This repository is not tested directly, tests are made through
Millipascal's frontend, using it's test suite.


Goals:

 - [ ] Have unsigned integers (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`)
 - [ ] Have floats (`f32`, `f64`)
 - [ ] Have malloc/free builtins
